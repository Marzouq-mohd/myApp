      <p class="intro">
        By 2016 there were at least 230 companies developing VR-related products.Facebook has 400 employees focused on VR development,Google,Apple,Amazon,Microsoft,Sony and Samsung all had AR and VR groups. Dynamic <a href="#">binaural audio</a> was common to most headsets released that year. However, haptic interfaces were not well developed, and most hardware packages incoporated button-operated handsets for touch-based interactivity.

      <h2>What's Virtual reality(VR)?</h2>
      <p>
         <strong>Virtual reality(VR)</strong> is a computer-generated scenario that stimulates arealistic experience. the immersive environment can be similar to the real world in order to create a lifelike experience grounded in reality or sci-fi. Augmented reality systems a form of VR that layers virtual information over a live camera feed into a headset,or through a smartphone or tablet device.
      </p>
      <p>
        Current VR technology most commonly uses <a href="#">virtual reality headsets</a> or multi-projected environments, sometimes in Combination with Physical environments or props, to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that stimulate a user's physical presence in a virtual or imaginary environment.

      <h2>Why Use One?</h2>
      <p>
          Mention virtual reality (or VR, as it is increasingly known) and you're likely to elicit one of two responses: either utmost enthusiasm and awareness, or something along the lines of Homer Simpson yelling "Neeeeerd!" But VR deserves to occupy a more substantive niche on the mainstream public radar, and here's why.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>VR has captured the popular imagination for a long time – and it's finally delivering</strong> <br>
        Excitement for virtual reality came to its first crest when the earliest consumer machines were introduced in the 1980s and 90s. Nintendo's Virtual Boy and various arcade and prototype systems helped establish the idea of what a VR system looks like, and inspired several movies, books, and music videos to boot. Still, their shortcomings left a campy, junky impression that's been hard to shake.
      </p>
      <p>       
        Insufficiencies are things of the past. Today's premium VR set-ups are capable, immersive, comfortable and increasingly affordable. High-end set ups like the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift allow you to use your own hands in virtual worlds and track your movement through space. While some may balk at the price tag (which starts around $1,400 if you include an entry-level gaming PC, headset and minimal accessories) the expense is dropping thanks to developments like Oculus' asynchronous spacewarp technology.

        The following are helpful tools that do most of the heavy lifting for you.

          <li><a href="#">UNREAL ENGINE (UE4)</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">3DS MAX & MAYA </a></li>

        </ul>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
          A society in which the ability to access virtual reality was hindered by the pressing supporters of the anti-VR movement, would be a tremendous downfall and a signal to our own ignorance in times of technological advancement. Virtual Reality is arguably the next footstep towards a modern/post-modern era of development. The potential ground breaking effects that loom behind these machines is uncanny. With the ability to save lives, act as a medium for business development and confrontations, and provide its users with endless hours of entertainment, learning, and discovery, the world should be pushing for an increased presence of this product, just the same as it did in the 1990’s. This time around, our technology will have come far enough to support the needs for these devices and will begin implementing virtual reality within homes, medical centers, and offices.
